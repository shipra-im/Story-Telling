Summary::
The dataset shows that most number of players are Right Handed.
The Left handed batsmen scored maximum HR and Avg.
Withe increasing weight the Avg is decreasing but home-runs are increasing.
With increasing Height HR and Avg both are decreasing.

Design::
    a)I have used the bar graphs for single variable distribution as   Handedness, Weight or Height distribution.
    b)Line charts have been used for 2 measure variables for the purpose of comparison between two variables like average and HR along with the trend lines to understand the increasing or decreasing trends.

Feedback::
RyanS::I have some feedback for you. But first a question. Did you create dashboards for your worksheets, then use dashboards for your story, or did you just put the worksheets in the story? The reason I ask is that your visualisations either make me scroll or do not fill the screen. Using dashboards will help with this. Secondly, I would suggest adding text boxes (which is something you can do with dashboards) rather than putting too much text in the comment boxes at the top of your story.

Have incorporated the changes after reviews being shared from Udacity itself.
